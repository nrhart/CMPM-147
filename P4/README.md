# p4-Feeding-Fish
## Noah Hart

In this Project I am trying to recreate the interation
that fish have with food. By creating an attraction function
the fish will go around the circle that is create which 
simulates fish food. The attraction force can change based
on the number inputed, I kept it mild in terms of strength 
otherwise the fish would have been to glued to it like a magnet.
With a weaker attraction force the fish are able to be pushed 
off the food so more can access it which feels more realistic.
