# p1-Tony's Demise
## Noah Hart

Tony's Demise takes the templates from the starter code and adds it's own theme,
which sort of mimics how some games have boss drop pools. So, the goal is for
a person to fight their way to the One Tony and kill to get a unqiue item
from his loot pool. Think of Tony as say... Morty from "Rick and Morty."
The catch is that the Tony at the top of the mountain as created clones of himself,
that act as bosses that spread across the land, which opens up the possibilty of 
turning this into an actualgame

In this assignment I focused on creating a setting which is the mountain pass, giving 
the enemies various names an adjectives. The main draw is the weapons the player is given
and the lootpool of the boss, which opens the possibility of deep lore implications.
