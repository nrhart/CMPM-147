# p3-autotiling
## Noah Hart

The effect that I was making was a world with sand and grass blocks
where the lava responds to autotiling when touch the 'grass' block.

I think it turned out really well and can be seen as more realistic
if the blocks were textured more akin to something like minecraft.

There could have been a more condense way to autotile the blocks like
rotating a dedicated draw function, but I had four seperate functions
that were called depending on what side of the tile it was need for
(west, east, north, south).

Lastly, I changed up the persistant tile when clicked to make it seem
like a water tile is being placed to add to the nature of a more lively
world.
