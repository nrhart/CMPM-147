This scene randomizes the height of each layer of the iceberg.
The pattern used is based of the sample code with creating many
side of a polygon, but it is more amplified in height. There
are also smaller oval shaped icebergs that spawn anywhere from 
1 - 5 in the water under layer of the scene.

In the original picture there was a Polarbear, so I made
that the interactive element by having it follow the mouse
within the water.

Overall I wanted to make the the Polar bear (Tony) stand out
while also maintaining the setting of the artic ocean. I think
the randomness of the icebergs makes it unqiue with each reroll
as the iceberg can be fairly mild in size, to very menacing.
