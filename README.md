p1-Tony's Demise
Tony's Demise takes the templates from the starter code and adds it's own theme,
which sort of mimics how some games have boss drop pools. So, the goal is for
a person to fight their way to the One Tony and kill to get a unqiue item
from his loot pool. Think of Tony as say... Morty from "Rick and Morty."

In this assignment I replaced many word throught relating to loot, the name of the towns, and
changed the adventure category to the Tony category to build into the theme I was trying to create.
